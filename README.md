In this tech blog application I made use of handlebars and the MVC paradigm to create a useful app where one can post their thoughts specifically regarding tech. There is a login and logout page and also a home and dashboard all found easily in the nav bar. Once signed in it is very easy to create a post just fill in the title of your post and what message you want to post then itll be good to post. Once posted it will show the date posted and by who. I'd like to continue working on this application in the future and work on things such as giving in more colorful styling and fonts, and adding a feature to be able to delete posts. I believe the login and logout buttons will need work as well since right now only the signup works 100% of the time. Below I have linked the URL to this tech blog appplication.
